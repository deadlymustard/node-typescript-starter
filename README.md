This mode will watch for changes and recompile itself automatically.

**Other Useful Commands**

Google's ts-style library has been integrated into this project. 
This lets us use a variety of commands to easily make code formatting consistent across
all files.

`npm run check` - Checks files for style consistency

`npm run compile` - Compiles Typescript code to es2016 Javascript (outputs to `dist`)

`npm run clean` - Clears out compiled dist files

`npm run fix` - Fixes style of files

**Running Tests**

`npm run test` - Runs tests
